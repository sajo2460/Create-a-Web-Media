# Create a Web Media

Calculate proportional sizes for a responsive web media. This tecnique can be used when working with any medium.
In this repository we start from an embed code we get from youtube and figure out how resize it for varying sizes in a web page . 

## Branches
This repository has branches for each step needed. 
You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the code at that stage. 
Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at.
